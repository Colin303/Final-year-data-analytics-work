# Final-year-data-analytics-work
This is just a collection of the reports I worked on during Final year. All of these reports were written in the IEEE format. 
The Code & Data behind this work is available upon request.

## Trends In Popular Song Lyrics, 1959 - 2017
This is a project for one of the machine learning modules I did. It uses data from Billboard top 100 of the week from 1959 - 2017 and analyses the content of the lyrics of the most popular songs. Using R, Python & Map Reduce patterns I take the data from each song, pass it to the GeniusAPI for the lyrics of that song, parse & count the lyrics to find the most popular word usage and display the results to find the most popular words.

## Data Mining, Analysis and Machine learning for Bike sharing
This was a group project data mining and machine learning techniques used to explore data and predict how many people would avail of a bike sharing service.

### Algorithms used
Decision Trees, Clustering, Multiple Linear Regression, conducting a statistical test for serial correlation and concluding with ARIMA and ARIMAX for time series analysis.

## Machine Learning Algorithms, and their usage for Autonomous Vehicles
This was only a report. We had to read & analyse multiple reports on a chosen topic and combine the information gathered into our own report on the topic. I chose Autonomous Vehicles because it's an area I'm deeply interested in.
